# Scientific Assignment

This repository contains solutions for the following Python tasks:

1. **Plot a line graph** representing temperature readings over a week.
2. **Generate an arithmetic sequence** starting at 5 with a common difference of 3, for 8 terms.
3. **Calculate the volume** under the surface z = x² + y² over the square region 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1.
4. **Explain the difference** between compiled and interpreted programming languages, and classify Python.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib scipy
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python assignment.scientific.py
   ```

The script will display a plot and print the results for the other tasks in the terminal.
